# About
DeleteWindows is an application that takes in a rvt file and outputs another rvt file with all of the windows removed. The files in this repository are to be used as exercise files for a the APS Auatomation course to convert a typical Revit add-in to a Design Automation ready Revit add-in.

This repository contains two folders. Each of them contains a C# project. Although the projects will be always migrated to latest release of Revit, it should be also working with previous releases (after re-built by the corresponding references & packages). 

- Desktop_Version - 
  Contains a C# project of the DeleteWindows sample, which produces an add-in that runs on the desktop version of Revit.  

- Design-Automation_Version - 
  Contains a C# project of the DeleteWindows sample, which produces an add-in that runs on Design Automation.

Refer to the readme in each folder for details on each project.
